### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, im Irtaza 
#### A Unity VR/MR Experience Developer Wiz

I've loved gaming far back as I can remember and was always intrigued by what goes on behind the curtains. This led to an early on exploration in the field of 2D and 3D game development which , over time transitioned into my love for building VR and MR experiences. 
I got to make my dream a reality. Ready to make your dream yours?



Skills: Unity / C# / Objective C / Python
